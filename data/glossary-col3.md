**Hit dice** the dice rolled to determine a char-
acter's hit points. Up to a certain level, one
or more new Hit Dice are rolled each time a
character attains a new class level. A fighter,
for example, has only one IO-sided Hit Die
(Idlo) at 1st level, but when he rises to the
2nd level, the player rolls a second d10, in-
creasing the character's hit points.
**Hit points** - a number representing 1. how
much damage a character can suffer before
being killed, determined by Hit Dice (9.u.).
The hit points lost to injury can usually be
regained by rest or healing. 2. how much
damage a specific attack does, determined
by weapon or monster statistics, and sub-
tracted from a player's total.

roll of a 10-sided die. The initiative roll is
eliminated if surprise (q.u.) is achieved.

cumulation of experience points to the 20th
level or higher. At each level attained, the
character received new powers. 2. spell
level, a measure of the power of a magical
