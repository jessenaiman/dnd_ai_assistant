**Ability** - any of the six natural traits that represent the basic definition of a player character: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. A player character's abilities are determined at the beginning of a game by rolling six-sided dice (d6s). The scores continue to be used throughout the game as a means of determining success or failure of many actions.

**Ability check** - a d20 roll against one of your character's ability scores (modifiers may be added to or subtracted from the die roll). A result that is equal to or less than your character's ability score indicates that the attempted action succeeds.

**AC** - abbreviation for Armor Class.

**Alignment** - a factor in defining a player character that reflects his basic attitude toward society and the forces of the universe. Basically, there are nine categories demonstrating the character's relationship to order vs. chaos and good vs. evil. A player character's alignment is selected by the player when the character is created.

**Area of effect** - the area in which a magical spell or a breath weapon works on any creatures unless they make a saving throw.

**Armor Class (abbr. AC)** - a rating for the protective value of a type of armor, figured from 10 (no armor at all) to 0 or even -10 (the best magical armor). The higher the AC, the more vulnerable the character is to attack.

**Attack roll** - The d20 roll used to determine if an attack is successful.

**Bend bars/lift gates roll** - the roll of percentile dice to determine whether a character succeeds in bending metal bars, lifting a heavy portcullis, or similar task. The result needed is a function of Strength and can be found in Table 1.

**Bonus spells** - extra spells at various spell levels that a priest is entitled to because of high Wisdom; shown in Table 5.

**Breath weapon** - the ability of a dragon or other creature to spew a substance out of its mouth just by breathing, without making an attack roll. Those in the area of effect must roll a saving throw.

**Cha** - abbreviation for Charisma.

**Chance of spell failure** - the percentage chance that a priest spell will fail when cast. Based on Wisdom, it is shown in Table 5.

**Chance to know spell** - the percentage chance for a wizard to learn a new spell. Based on Intelligence, it is shown in Table 4.

**Charisma (abbr. Cha)** - an ability score representing a character's persuasiveness, personal magnetism, and ability to lead.

**Common** - the language that all player characters in the AD&W game world speak. Other languages may require the use of proficiency slots.

**Con** - abbreviation for Constitution.

**Constitution (abbr. Con)** - an ability score that represents a character's general physique, hardiness, and state of health.
